      "description": "The assignment was to create a poster about Earth Overshoot Day using self-taken photographs. I wanted to design a poster that would catch people's attention and encourage them to take a closer look. I came up with the idea of hollowing out a mandarin and photographing it with a hole in it. This symbolises our Earth, which could also be an empty shell without resources in the future."

For 'The Fault in Our Stars', I wove the letters of 'stars' together and mirrored an R. For 'Mockingjay', I created a visual focus in the middle of the book by making the letters of 'mock' progressively smaller and directing the A's of 'jay' towards the centre. For 'The Maze Runner', I drew a maze inside the N."
